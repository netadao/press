NETA DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by its members to act as a Community Accelerator for funding and development of $NETA and NETA DAO.

# Neta DAO focus
**Create positive or net neutral outcomes**  
Neta DAO will curate regenerative and sustainable sources of community funding. Create an inclusive mission that maximizes community participation, engagement, commitment, and investment.

**Promote contribution to the DAO**  
The DAO is a reflection of communal value.

**Facilitate Community Accelerators**  
Community accelerators: mechanisms that rapidly create value, appreciate value, and distribute value. The ultimate vision of the DAO as an infinite driver of value.

**Facilitate Community Generators**  
Similar to Community Accelerators, developing tools/pathways to encourage participation in the DAO. An example of this is artwork NFTs, drawing people looking to extract value.

**Facilitate Community Cultivators**  
Create an environment for the community to develop tools/pathways that foster active retention in the DAO

**Secure NETA's use case as a store of value (SoV)**  
Given the DAO functions as a relational support for NETA's use case, the DAO works to support value generators to participants and prospective members so that they may support the DAO's mission by their engagement.

# Membership in the Neta DAO
**Community**  
By staking your $NETA in the NETA DAO, you will help build the Community Accelerator for the NETA and Juno ecosystems and be granted benefits such as access to specialized dApps, airdrops, exclusive NFTs, and NFT whitelists.

**Direction**  
By being a member of the NETA DAO community, one will be able to voice their input not only via commonwealth, but also exercise their right to vote on DAO direction, initiatives, Community Accelerator project development, and funding decisions.

**Treasury**  
You will serve a key role in curating and voting for allocation and use of the NETA DAO Treasury and LP incentivized pool funds. The NETA DAO will look to grow and collaborate with like-minded teams and DAOs for the betterment of IBC network.

**Community Accelerator**  
Using NETA DAO as a lever for change, teams building in this ecosystem can apply to NETA DAO's Community Accelerator program to tap into not only funding for their projects, but also a network of dedicated Neta and Juno community members. The NETA DAO Community Accelerator program works to fund, advise and develop this network of dApps, NFTs, Games, and smart contracts utilizing $NETA. Developers, artists and teams working with the NETA DAO will be featured in the Neta ecosystem, web app, promotional material, and revenue share or equity in the NETA DAO in exchange for their contribution.

**Guidance**  
Ultimately, NETA DAO will serve as a beacon for passionate individuals seeking to **learn from** and **give back** to the community that birthed it, acting as a home of collaboration, discussion, growth, and innovation. We can leverage our passion, creativity, and human capital within the community to be ambassadors of the Cosmos, giving people an opportunity to build for the larger IBC community and for Juno Network, stabilizing and solidifying value and cementing its status as an ecosystem pillar.

Juno's aim was to be entirely community owned, free of venture capital investment and distributed to early Cosmos supporters with no presale; NETA was distributed to early supporters of Juno who took an active part in its governance. NETA DAO aims to continue that ethos: assisting and rewarding early adopters, supporters, contributors, and builders. We intend to show that a collection of people from around the world can create and achieve something remarkable without a figurehead or traditional organizational structure.
